# Least-squares-fitting-of-a-spectral-line

The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) is an extensive survey involving both multi-filter imaging and spectroscopic redshift analysis. Over the past two decades, it has gathered spectra for a vast number of objects, primarily focusing on quasars and distant galaxies, totaling more than four million entries. All of this data is accessible to the public through the SDSS website at sdss.org.

In this project, we used spectra from the SDSS Data Release 9 (DR9) to determine the redshifts (z = (λobs − λlab)/λlab) for several quasars. We accomplished this by fitting either a Gaussian or Cauchy line profile to the Mg II emission line at λlab = 2800.3 ̊A. Additionally, we estimated the uncertainty of the resulting redshifts.
